PowerBI Project

In this project I downloaded a free dataset from a YouTube channel. 

First, with Power Query I have checked all of the three different sheets and I have cleaned the data for a more precise outcomes. 

Then, I transformed the data and hover an additional keys of different sheets to connect the sheets.

After that, I have generate 4 different visuals to explain my data.

As you can see there is a pie chart on the left hand side, it can be clearly seen that in different years what is the percentage of sum of the sales.

Right side of the pie chart, there is a tree map. In this map it can clearly seen that highest dates and their corresponding values.

On the left bottom side there is a slicer of the professions of the customers. With clicking any of the profession there, it can clearly seen that which profession is expends more.

On the middle of the bottom side, there is a Card visual. You can see Gross Profit. It is connected to the other charts, it is dynamic.

Finally, on the bottom right side there is a new feature of the Power Bi, you can connect with the AI and you can ask questions to get another insights.
